If you drove a steady 75 mph without ever slowing

down or stopping it would take you over 26 hours to
drive 2,000 miles. More than a day.

Well, assuming you're correct then let's suppose
that | didn't sleep to have more time in a day, then |

could probably make it. And what are your sources
for your data?

It’s called math, you should try it some time.
