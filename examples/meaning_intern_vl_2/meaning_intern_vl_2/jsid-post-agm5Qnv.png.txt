The image contains a humorous meme that plays on the idea of college education and job qualifications. The text reads:

"forget everything you learned in college, you won't need it working here"
"but, I didn't go to college"

The punchline is:

"well then, you're unqualified for this job"

The meme humorously suggests that even if one did not attend college, they are still not qualified for the job in question. The cat in the image, with its starburst mark, adds a comical element to the joke, as it appears to be looking at the text with a puzzled or confused expression.
