The image is a humorous meme that plays on the common phrase "Password Incorrect" to create a comical situation. The meme uses a cat with glasses to represent the user, and it humorously illustrates the consequences of entering the wrong password. Here's a breakdown of the humor:

1. **First Row:**
   - The text reads: "Password Incorrect"
   - The cat is shown with a confused expression, looking at the screen.
   - The text below reads: "*Resets password*"

2. **Second Row:**
   - The text reads: "Password Incorrect"
   - The cat is shown with a surprised or confused expression, looking at the screen.
   - The text below reads: "Your password cannot be your previous password"

3. **Third Row:**
   - The text reads: "Your password cannot be your previous password"
   - The cat is shown with a shocked or confused expression, looking at the screen.
   - The text below reads: "*Resets password*"

The humor arises from the absurdity of the situation: the cat, with glasses, is shown as if it is trying to enter a password, but the cat's expression and the text below indicate that it is resetting the password. This creates a comical effect by exaggerating the user's mistake and the cat's reaction.
