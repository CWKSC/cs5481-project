ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP?

YES I AM. NOW SHUT UP.

In Darth Vader's death scene, you can hear blaster shots going off in the background. Luke is the only Rebel on Death Star 2, and the stormtroopers aren't shooting at him. The Death Star is getting ready to explode, and all the imperial troops are evacuating. So the only thing those blaster shots could be for stormtroopers killing each other on the ships.
