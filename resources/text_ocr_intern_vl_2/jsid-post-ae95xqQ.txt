Representation matters. Inclusivity is not the same as racism.
Enjoy hating on me for today. I'll go back to making games.

Just wait until they notice that none of our starting characters in our alpha build are white males.
None. Out of 6.

Imagine if you wrote "black males." How would that look?
Equality, not equity.

Two women sharing intimate stories about getting our periods in the merch store is the state of the game industry. #GDC24
This is what games look like.

It's seriously have other women in this industry - to be vulnerable and real with them in a way that we can't be with the majority of devs.
This GDC was the most female powered of any of my past GDCs. I am 💪🏻 here for this.
