I got a call from my wife to pick her up from yoga, "Honey didn't you drive yourself?" I asked. "Frank just come and pick me up. Don't ask any questions and please hurry!" When I got there I understood why she needed a ride, but I still do not understand how she managed to get into this predicament.
