They don't know that the name Gandalf comes from Norse mythology in the poem Volsunga, stanza 12, where the name Gandalf is mentioned first as the name of some dwarf, with the name meaning something among the lines of "magic elf", which makes sense as another word for dwarf is "dark elf", as dwarfs in Norse myth are a version of elves that live underground

Let's call him Grand Elf! Haha
