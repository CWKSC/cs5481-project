People are asking what this means, so:

Liu Bang was a provincial constable (basically who escaped. The penalty for allowing prisoners to escape was death, so my look at his prospects and said "welp, in for a penny, in for a pound" and decided to go up with the dudes who'd been his prisoners 5 minutes ago. This kicked off a chain of events that led to him becoming a bandit chief and eventually a rebel general and ended with him overthrowing the Qin dynasty and becoming Emperor Gaozu of Han.

And you think you had a weird day at work
