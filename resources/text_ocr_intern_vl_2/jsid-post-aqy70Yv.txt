Cranky old guy at the range starter pack

His aresenle only takes out once or twice a year ->

Gets angry when anyone fires off more than 60 rpm

Is a backseat shooter

Thinks anything he doesn't personally use for hunting is a stupid gimmick.

Still smells of deer piss

Demands to see paperwork for you're not required to have it

Disdain for polymer, hard plastic or black material
