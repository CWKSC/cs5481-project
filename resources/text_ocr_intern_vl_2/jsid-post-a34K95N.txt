Can you focus on fixing/supporting Bitmap fonts to properly import into your engine first instead of doing this sort of thing it's delaying my project a lot this having to try to fix this with the little documentation you have for

blocking me for this really mild criticism for something that should be in a 2D engine a while now is making me consider switching to a different engine. There's a proper use of resources and it should be done to fix the engine. There's stuff you have there, not adding new things.
