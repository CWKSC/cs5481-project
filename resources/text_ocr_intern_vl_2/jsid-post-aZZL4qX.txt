a friend of mine tried to sell his soul on ebay and the starter price was $10 and people were bidding on it but before anything happened ebay took it down and sent him an email explaining that if he was selling a soul that didn't actually exist then it was against their policy and if he was selling a real soul then that is a human body part and it is also against their policy
