MR. PEABODY, YOU MADE A NEW FRIEND.
RIB.

THAT'S YOUR PET?
RIB.

AND HIS NAME'S PARKER.

IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?
RIB.

THE LAW DOES APPLY TO YOU.

DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR RESPONSIBILITY?

LOOK, YOU CAN'T HAVE A PET. YOU'RE MY PET.

A PET'S PET CAN'T HAVE THEIR OWN PET.

PARKER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

THIS HAS GONE TOO DEEP.
