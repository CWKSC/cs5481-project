Here's an idea...
A reality show where Socialist college students are sent to a country that closely resembles their desired political system and left to survive for a few months

Here is another. We take all the capitalist frat boys whose daddy is a lawyer, and we make them pay their education while working for minimum wage in Amazon and spending 40% on rent. How long will it be before they ask to unionize?
