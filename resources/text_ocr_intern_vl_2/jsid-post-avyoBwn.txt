Well, looks like Johnny Somali is slowly realising that perhaps he's biting off more than he can chew with his blatant heinous behaviour in Korea.

So not only are Korean livestreamers chipping in to give a $700USD equivalent reward to those who find him and record his movement.

Also, it seems Korean parliament is also looking at Johnny's movements, with keen interest.

The footage of him being confronted is also being shown on Korean News on television. His face clearly plastered in the News reports.

Especially after he was caught in an assault charge, narcissistic possession...and of course public disdain due to what he did to some of Korea's WW2 Memorial statues.

All this being said, I am still of the opinion that Johnny has not even remotely received the due repercussions of his actions.
