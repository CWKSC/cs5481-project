DO YOU NEED TO BE A WRITER, AN ARTIST, A MUSICIAN TO ENJOY SOME WRITING, PAINTING, SINGING?

NO YOU DO NOT. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. IMAGINE YOU HAVE TO DO SOME SORTS OF TEST, OR EXERCISE EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO ENJOY A SONG, A MOVIE, A COMIC. IT KIND OF TAKES AWAY THE FUN, DOESN'T IT?

THE SAME WITH SCIENCE, MATH, PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, TECHNOLOGY. YOU DON'T NEED TO GET SOME CERTAIN DEGREES TO ENJOY THEM.

MOST STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT TO DO TESTS, SOLVE PROBLEMS WHEN IT COMES TO THESE SUBJECTS. IT'S GOOD FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO BECOME TECHNICIAN, PHYSICIST, CHEMIST, DOCTOR BUT CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND FRUSTRATING FOR THOSE WHO JUST WANT TO ENJOY SOME GOOD KNOWLEDGE.
