Honey, please wake up our son.

The vast majority of relationships end long before marriage. Many of the few that don't end in divorce. Of the ones that don't many people aren't happy and stay because obligation or fear. The few that don't get divorced and have a happy relationship usually one spouse dies before the other leaving one to live without them. Even if you somehow both pass at the same time or you happen to be the first to go at the end you can't even comprehend or focus on the other person being there as you die so effectively we all die alone.
