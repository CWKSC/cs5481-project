Tasty and portable But I use these for trapping rats because the rats love them

I love these but I had to stop beating them due to the sodium. We have an occasional rat problem on our property and when I set out the traps I started using small pieces of these instead of peanut butter and they are virtually 100% effective because they are irresistible and stick to the trap better rather than something that can be easily licked off like peanut butter. Because they grip the trigger mechanism better and they are so delicious the rats can't help themselves but to get caught
