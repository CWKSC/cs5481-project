FOOLISH MORTAL, WHO DARES ENTER THE DISTORTION REALM, THE ETERNAL EXILE OF THE ALMIGHTY GIRATINA? DO YOU CONSPIRE TO DUEL MY TRANSCENDENT FORM WITH YOUR PITIFUL MONSTERS OF THE PHYSICAL REALM? SUCH A TRIFFLE.

THIS LAND IS AT THE CONTROL OF MY LIMITLESS WILL, HERE, I BECOME UNDEFEATABLE. NOW LEAVE, AND I SHALL SPARE YOU THE TORMENT OF AN UNHOLY DEFEAT AT MY HAND.

WELL, SHIT.
