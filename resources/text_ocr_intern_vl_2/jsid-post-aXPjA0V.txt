So, if you're a captain, and I'm a Jedi, I technically outrank you, right?

In my book, experience outranks everything.

Well you're biologically 20, but are technically 10 years old and have been training on Kamino since birth. I'm 14 and have been in the Jedi order since I was an infant. Therefore, if experience outranks everything, then I outrank you.
