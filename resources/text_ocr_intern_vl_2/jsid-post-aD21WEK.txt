Wouldn't it be crazy if one of the richest lithium deposits in the world was right off of Asheville if the North Carolina mining company in the world 3 days before the flood began, submitted the permits for their mine right outside Asheville North Carolina?

Wasn't it just given $250 million in mining company grants to help with construction of their mine right outside of Asheville North Carolina?

Wouldn't it be crazy if less than a month before the flood started, Blackrock acquired 2.2 million shares of stock in the mining company if the residents that opposed the mine had their homes and property destroyed?
