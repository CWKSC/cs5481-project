"Le driving home from work one day, I was listening to the radio for the first time in a long while. The random radio ad appears."

"Is it as tasty as McDonald's? Can it measure up to Steve?"

"It's as delicious as Steve is?"

"SLLLURRRRRPPPP"

"Mommm, just as tasty as Steve! Now only 1.58 at McDonald's. I'm lovin' it."

"What the hell is McDonald's selling?"
