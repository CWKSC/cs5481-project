Scared by that new report on climate change? Here's what you can do to help:
- Eat less meat (about 30%)
- Swap your car or plane ride for a bus or train
- Use a smart thermostat in your home

reminder that 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions and presenting the crisis as a moral failing on the part of individuals without noting this fact is journalistic malpractice.
