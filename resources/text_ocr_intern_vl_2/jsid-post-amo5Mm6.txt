Not allowed to work from home so I don't

My job recently told me that even during the snowstorm we got earlier this week, I am not allowed to work from home at all. Even though I work in IT and do everything remotely, they want me in the office.

So I deleted Teams and my email off my phone. I am no longer available after hours.

My boss tried to call me for something urgent last night and couldn't reach me. He asked why today and I explained to him what I was told.

I am not allowed to work from home.
