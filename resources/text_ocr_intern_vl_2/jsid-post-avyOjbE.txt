THE "THAT ONE DUDE AT EVERY GYM" STARTERPACK

Biggest dude you've ever seen

Wears old pants and a hoodie for a home renovation company

Has a bulky pair of headphones he bought in 2009

Benches a ridiculous amount of weight without a spotter (don't worry about it though, he's got it)

Doesn't bring a water bottle, just hits the gym water fountain for two seconds on his way out

You've never seen him talk to anyone
