she must be busy
maybe she don't have notifications on
she's thinking of a good way to reply
she will reply tomorrow, she must be sleeping it's already 7pm
It takes her a long time to reply not because she's busy but because she does not want to chat with me
She cancels plans with me when she finds literally anything else to do
She initiates small fights in which she tries to demean me
My only purpose in her life is to give her attention and boost her confidence when asked
I'm not going to waste my time and energy this way anymore
Hi, do you have any plans this weekend?
I'm in!
