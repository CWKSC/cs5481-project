A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

They are not all accounted for. We do not know who else may be watching.

That is why I use Nord VPN. With Nord VPN, my identity is protected so I can stay safe when using my palantir. With dedicated servers across all of Middle Earth, I can use it knowing that my thoughts don't end up in the wrong hands.

And right now, you can enjoy 50% off your first 12 months by using my code ISTARIS. It would be wise, my friend.
