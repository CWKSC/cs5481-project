Toyota Motor Corp. is planning to move away from DEI and pro-LGBTQ events after recently facing online controversy, according to a new report.

Bloomberg reported the company sent out a memo to its US employees Thursday saying it will "narrow community activities to align with STEM education and workforce readiness" and no longer participate in the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.
