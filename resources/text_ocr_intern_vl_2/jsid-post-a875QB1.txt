Nobody Will Remember:
- Your salary
- How "busy" you were
- How many hours you worked
- How many Gucci bags you owned

People Will Remember:
- How often you sent memes
- The quality of the memes you sent
- How good you were at finding a meme for every situation
- If they forwarded your memes to other people
