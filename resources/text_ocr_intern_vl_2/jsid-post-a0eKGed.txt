2000 miles isn't that much honestly, I could drive that much in a day

If you drove a steady 75 mph without ever slowing down or stopping it would take you over 26 hours to drive 2,000 miles. More than a day.

Well, assuming you're correct then let's suppose that I didn't sleep to have more time in a day, then I could probably make it. And what are your sources for your data?

Source: 2,000/75 = 26.6666667

It's called math, you should try it some time.

Well, I'm not sure if I agree but ok
