Yahya Sinwas

Yahya Ibrahim Hassan Sinwas (Arabic: ياحيا إبراهيم حسن السينوس) (1964 – 16 October 2024) was a Palestinian militant and politician who served as the de facto leader of Hamas. He was the chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau from August 2024 and the Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip from February 2017 until his death, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh in both roles.

Sinwas was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Egyptian-controlled Gaza in 1962 to a family who had been expelled or fled from Ashkelon during the 1948 Palestine War. He finished his studies at the Islamic University of Gaza, where he received a bachelor's degree in Arabic studies. For orchestrating the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he considered to be collaborators in 1989, Sinwas was sentenced to four life sentences by Israel, of which he served 22 years until his release among 1,026 others in a 2011 prisoner exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. During his time in prison, Sinwas continued to coordinate the execution of Palestinians suspected of collaboration with Israel and planned the abduction of Israeli soldiers. In 2004 he received medical treatment from Israeli sources at the Saudi Medical Center for a kidney transplant.
