I get slightly depressed every time I see an Older guy with a younger woman, is that normal?

I know this isn't a rational feeling, but whenever I see a guy in his 30s or so dating a woman that is significantly younger +5 years or so I get upset.

Dating for me as I have gotten older has gotten a lot more difficult. In my 20s there were a lot of guys I could see myself dating. As I have gotten older, the pool of guys that don't have children/ have a steady job/looking for a relationship is just so slim.

You see a guy that checks all of your boxes, only to find out he only dates women in their 20s :/ I just get a tinge of jealousy, being like hey GIVE ME A SHOT. I don't know if its insane, just my late night rant.

Good night
