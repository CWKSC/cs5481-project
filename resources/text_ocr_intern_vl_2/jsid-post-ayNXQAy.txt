[Speaking Elvish] These men look ready for battle. I believe we can win this fight.

I don't wanna die.

Then I shall die as one of them!

Wait, I never sai...

And the man on my left isn't that overweight!

Typical elf twat. That's just mean.

Why would he say that?

You cruel elf.

Even Grima was better than this.
