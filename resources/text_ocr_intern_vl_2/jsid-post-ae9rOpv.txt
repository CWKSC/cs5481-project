You can't hide from me Jon...

My five eyes bear witness to the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Wait, what's going on in your abdomen here? Huh?

We better get you checked.

Unfortunately, you have appendicitis. We'll have to operate.

Alright.

The operation was a success!

Thanks for looking out for me Garfield.

I love you Jon.
