The CIA in movies:
We're going to save America & the World.

Hell yeah.

The CIA in real life:
Our financing of Right Wing dictatorships [Operation Condor] in South America so far has caused tens of thousands of innocent civilian deaths & countless human rights abuses.

Iol At least the Soviets can't ally with anyone down there now.
