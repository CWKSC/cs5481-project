I went out with this girl one time and she take a look at the menu and ordered the most expensive wine 🍷 OMG 😂 as i was there trying to panic the waiter just take one look at me bro to bro and told her they are out of stock, she asked for like 3 other bottles which are expensive and he gave her the same reply until she mentioned something I could afford, and I nodded then he proceed and brought it in, OMG this was my best bro code moment, i went back to give him a tip but bro declined.
