ORIGIN OF MONTH NAMES

Our lives run on Roman time. The names of our months are therefore derived from the Roman gods, leaders, festivals, and numbers.

JANUARY
January is named after the Roman god Janus. As you can see in this print, he had two faces so he could see the future and the past.

FEBRUARY
February is named after the Roman calendar month of Februarius, which was a festival of purification and atonement that took place during this period.

MARCH
March is named after Mars, the Roman god of War. This was the time of year to resume military campaigns that had been interrupted by winter.

APRIL
April takes its name from the Latin word aperire, meaning "to open" (just like flowers do in spring). The Romans called the month Aprilis.

MAY
Named after the Roman goddess Maia, who oversaw the growth of plants. Maia was considered a nurturing earth goddess, which may explain the connection with this springtime month.

JUNE
Named for the Roman goddess Juno, patroness of marriage. Also from the Latin word juvenes, "young people."

JULY
This month used to be called Quintilis - the Roman word for "fifth" as it was the fifth month of the Roman year. It was later changed to July by the Roman world, after Julius Caesar, after his family name (Julius).

AUGUST
This month was first called Sextilis - the Roman word for "sixth" as it was the sixth month of the Roman year. It was later changed to August by the Emperor Augustus, and named it after himself.

SEPTEMBER
September comes from the Latin word septem, meaning "seven," because it was the seventh month of the early Roman calendar.

OCTOBER
Its name is derived from octo, Latin for "eight," an indication of its position in the early Roman calendar.

NOVEMBER
November was the ninth month of the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC. November retained its name (from the Latin novem, meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar.

DECEMBER
It comes from the Latin word decem, meaning ten, because this had been the tenth month of an early Roman calendar.
