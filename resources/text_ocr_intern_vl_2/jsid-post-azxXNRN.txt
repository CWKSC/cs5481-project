I love life.

Huh? But you just got dumped.

Well yea, and I'm sad

But at the same time I'm really happy that something can make me feel that sad.

It makes me feel human. The only way I can feel bad is if I know that something can make me feel good. So guess what I'm feeling is like a beautiful sadness.

It's like, it makes me feel alive. You know?
