A soulmate,
is someone who challenges you to be better, someone who can't stand seeing you sad, someone who stays faithful, loyal and committed to you, someone who helps take care of you when you're sick,
someone who stands by your side through the good days and the bad days, and someone who wants to grow old and grey with you.
