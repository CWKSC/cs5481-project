Don't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant. Abortions aren't necessary.

I do what I want. Stop trying to control women's bodies!

If you can choose to opt out of pregnancy, men must be able to opt out of child support.

Urgh. Don't have sex if you don't want to pay child support. You can't just shirk your responsibilities.
