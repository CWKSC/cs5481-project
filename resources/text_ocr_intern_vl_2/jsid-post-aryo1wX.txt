It began with the forging of the Great Rings

Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings

Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls

And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power

But they were all of them deceived as all the rings where made from really shitty copper
