Just an October Reminder

- Werewolves are usually very sore after transforming, give them a heating pad and some gentle massages and be sure to keep plenty of food and water on hand.
- Vampires don't mind the colder weather so I'll blend in to wear jackets and long sleeves so that they'll blend in with the cold populace.
- The monster that lives under your bed likes the smell of fresh baked cookies. Lush your bed with the scent.
- The shadow people actually like nightlights because more light means more shadows.
- The woods likes watching you and beast your friends around the campfire. They like pretending they're part of the group.
- Minims love Halloween because their costumes are always the best.
- This is an important month for witches. Supply them with mason jars and remember to put out the moon water for them.
- The three monster that chases you in the woods and doesn't mean to scare you, they just need nail clippers.
