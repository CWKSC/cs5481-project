I meet someone

They leave

We talk

I tell how the Jedi Order's problem is Yoda. No being can wield that kind of power for centuries without becoming complacent at best or corrupt at worst. He has no idea that it's overtaken him; he no longer sees all the little cumulative evils that the Republic tolerates and fosters, from slavery to endless wars, and acting on this" Live alongside corruption for too long, and you no longer notice the stench. The Jedi cannot help the slaves of Tatoine, but they can help the slave-masters.
