I really liked colored hair on people before and miss 2000s when colored hair was mostly used by emo chicks with pink and black hair, goth with dark green and even some nu-metal fans occasionally. Nowadays I do not see colored hair on quirky emo chicks anymore, now it is mostly used by whales and political activists, and became just a sign of metal retardation, and it makes me sad.
