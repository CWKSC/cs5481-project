ALPHA LEGION
CONSPIRACY THEORIES

#1 They're after a weapon with the power to kill Roboute Guilliman so Alphanius can take his place and rule the Imperium.

#2 They're seeking Horus' soul to resurrect him.

#3 Half of the Legion is fighting for Chaos and the other half for the Imperium... and they're not sure which is which.

#4 There is no Alpha Legion at all, and they're all Heretic Astartes of other Legions in disguise.

#5 The Emperor Himself tasked Alphanius with a secret mission... and it's nearly complete.
