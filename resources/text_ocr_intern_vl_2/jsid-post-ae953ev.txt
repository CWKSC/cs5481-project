What? Why? How? No! -mmm!
You JUST raised prices the other day!
Why does cupcake cost even MORE now?!

Hey, I'm not the one setting prices.
You need to vent - go ask the owner.
Though... honestly, less?
I can probably guess what he'd say.

The carts we're using to deliver pastries to this here market need wheels replaced regularly. And those have recently gone up in price.

I'm willing to bet the owner's just trying to cover those costs.

Come to think of it, aren't you a carpenter for that wheel workshop yourself? Shouldn't you be earning more now as well?

No... Gabi knows nothing... about that... wait.

Is Gabi... paying for the wheels Gabi makes?
