People have rights.
Ideas don't have rights.

Every ideology must be subjected to open, free discussion in regard to its value or otherwise, without fear of reprisal. No exceptions.
"Islamophobia" is not racism, any more than "Communism" or "Fascism" would be, because Islam is an idea, not a race.
In a civilised society, no idea – religious, political or philosophical – can claim any special treatment, or be set beyond the reach of empirical evidence.

Support free speech. Support people.
