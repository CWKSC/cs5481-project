Sony on Tuesday announced the closure of Firewalk Studios, 18 months after acquiring the Bellevue, Wash.-based game developer.

Firewalk's first and only project was Concord, a multiplayer action game for Windows and PlayStation 5 that released on Aug. 23. In a controversial move, Sony shut down Concord's servers after only two weeks, citing poor sales and low player counts, and offered a refund to anyone who'd bought the game.
