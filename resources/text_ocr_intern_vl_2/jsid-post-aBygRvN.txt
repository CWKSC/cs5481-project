What all are we doing at kyker farms?

Everything we physically can

Lmao

So do we shoot the zombies? Or do we get shot at too?

Corn mazing, hay riding, pumpkin patching, zombie shooting, haunted trailing

We do not get shot at

This is a one way situation

The day zombies pick up a gun all of the zombie movies are going to drastically change
