UBISOFT

You are now the new CEO of Ubisoft
How do you save the company?

Em reposta @Pirat_Nation

>First day as CEO

>Fire anyone with:
1) Pronouns in Bio
2) Brightly colored hair
3) Overt activism on their public Social Media Profiles
4) The entire HR team

Results:

>Costs get cut by 60% by laying off all the useless deadweight & keeping only meritorious devs
>Games get made for GAMERS and not a screaming activist minority
>Customers LIKE the games again instead of actively rejecting them

Congratulations, Ubisoft is highly profitable again.
