Obi-Wan, is Anakin alright?

Calm down and rest Padme, everything will be alright...
Anakin is dead though. At least, I'm pretty sure he's dead. He was screaming in agony and burning alive when I left him all alone on the shore of the lava ocean. If it's any consolation to you, he suffered quite a lot, and for all I know still is suffering.
