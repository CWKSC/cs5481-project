ARE YA WINNING, SON?

No dad, I'm not winning. I am a 32 year old man living with my parents. No girlfriend, no one to check in on me. I spent $4000 on this gaming setup in a feeble attempt to bring joy to my life, although there is no pleasure to be found. As I log in to master chief collection to relive the years that I was actually happy and am welcomed with an empty friendlist, I am reminded that I am alone. I've lost, dad.
