White Male Writer Sues CBS For “Reverse Discrimination”

03/06/2024

CBS Studios and its parent Paramount have been sued in a “reverse discrimination” case for allegedly carrying diversity quotas that discriminate against straight white men.

He was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that promoted the hiring of “less qualified applicants who were members of more preferred groups,” namely those who identify as part of a minority group, the LGBTQ community, or women.

In 2019, when he asked why a Black writer was hired instead of him, he was allegedly told by the showrunner that it was because CBS wanted a minority to satisfy racial quotas for its writers’ rooms. The studio indicated to him that he “did not check any diversity boxes” as a straight, white man.

For the 2022-23 broadcast season, the network said in 2020 that half of all writers must be nonwhite as part of a broad initiative to “more accurately reflect diversity both on-screen and behind-the-camera.”

There is no such thing as reverse sexism, reverse racism, or reverse discrimination

It’s still sexism, racism, and discrimination
