I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND

Plot twist:
Obi Wan is the king of low grounds, not high grounds. He defeated both maul and grievious by having the low ground. When he told anakin "I have the high ground" it was simply to tempt him to jump and get the high ground, therefore giving Obi Wan the low ground where he could easily take him down. Obi Wan is the master of trolling.
