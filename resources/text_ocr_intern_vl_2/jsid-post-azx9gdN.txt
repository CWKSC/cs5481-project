Not bad, I have spent around 45 minutes completing captcha-s and email + sms verifications
Trying to log into an already existing account is a quick time event:
- you get code, a link you can not copy, and a QR code that doesn't work
- the code expires in 1.4 minutes, you have to restart the captcha if you run out of time
- when you try to log in, each time you have to fill an increasing number of captchas (my pb is 10)
- the captcha has an increasing number of images, with dice on them which you have to sum up and try to find the one image that shows the amount required
- if you just fail one, you start over
- when you pass this part, there is 10% chance it doesn't show a random error
- in case it works, you need to either confirm with email or sms (tried both, sms is less boring)
- at this point you have a 20% chance that you get "Accept terms of service" page.
- otherwise you are logged out and start again
- If you manage to accept that, you can play the game

Time to beat: 45 minutes GLHF

Also, there is some kind of shooter game after this part, I do not recommend that one.
