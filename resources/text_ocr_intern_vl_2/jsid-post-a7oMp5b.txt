I dated a guy in 2021 who was kind and had a good heart but was always broke. Unsure of how to end things, I faked my own unaliving by texting him as my cousin and telling him only family could attend my funeral due to regulations. After blocking him, I monitored his posts from a fake account and saw he was devastated. Luckily, we had no mutual friends, so my active profile remained hidden. Now that he's doing well and has a great job, I want to reconnect but don't know how since he thinks I'm dead. Helpp me because I love this man.
