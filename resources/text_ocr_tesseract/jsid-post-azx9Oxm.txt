After watching new joker, i realised that
the real clown wasn't neither arthur, not
harley, not the judicial system, not the
arkham patients or their guards. It also
isnt the movies actors, its screenwriter,
director and producer todd phillips. The
teal clown was me because i spent
money to see it 15:27
