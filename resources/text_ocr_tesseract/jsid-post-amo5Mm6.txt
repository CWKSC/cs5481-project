Not allowed to work from home so | don't

My job recently told me that even during the snowstorm
we got earlier this week, | am not allowed to work from
home at all. Even though | work in IT and do everything
remotely, they want me in the office.

So | deleted Teams and my email off my phone. | am no
longer available after hours.

My boss tried to call me for something urgent last night
and couldn’t reach me. He asked why today and |
explained to him what | was told.

1am not allowed to work from home.
