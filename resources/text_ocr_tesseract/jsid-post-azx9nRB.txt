a

My grandfathe /me that he
saw the Titanic, i ah that from
the beginning he warned all
people that the ship would sink,
but nobody listened to him.

He was a brave man. He did not
give up. He warned them again
and again on several occasions...
until they kicked him out of

the cinema.
