If | choose to no longer use the Gemini
chat feature, how do | turn it off or disable
the feature?

As an Al language model, | cannot be
turned off or disabled. If you're not
interested in using my services, you can
simply stop interacting with me. There's
no specific setting or button to disable
me.
