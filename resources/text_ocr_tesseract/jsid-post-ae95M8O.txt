In his book "The Grand Design", Hawking
stated that the universe could have created
itself from nothing due to the laws of physics,
specifically quantum mechanics. He argued
that because there is a law such as gravity,
the universe can and will create itself from
nothing. This means the Big Bang could have
occurred without the need for a divine cause
or creator.
