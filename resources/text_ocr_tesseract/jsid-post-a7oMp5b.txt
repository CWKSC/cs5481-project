| dated a guy in 2021 who was kind and had a good
heart but was always broke. Unsure of how to end
things, | faked my own unaliving by texting him as my
cousin and telling him only family could attend my

funeral due to regulations. After blocking him, |
monitored his posts from a fake account and saw he
was devastated. Luckily, we had no mutual friends, so
my active profile remained hidden. Now that he's doing
well and has a great job, | want to reconnect but don't
know how since he thinks I'm degd. Helppp me
because | love this man.
