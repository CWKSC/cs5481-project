* Werewolves are usually very sore after transforming, give them a
heating pad and some gentle massages and be sure to keep
plenty of food and water on hand.

* Vampires don't mind the colder weather so remind them to wear
Jackets when they go out at night so that they'll blend in better
with the cold populace.

‘+ The monster that lives under your bed likes the smell of the
candles you burn in your room, Lush Forest is their favorite scent.

* The shadow people actually like nightlights because more light
means more shadows.

* The beast that lives in the woods likes watching you and your
friends around the campfire. They like pretending they're part of
the group.

‘* Mimics love Halloween because their costumes are always the
best.

* This is an important month for witches. Supply them with mason
Jars and remember to put out the moon water for them.

* The tree monster that clicks and clacks on your window doesn't
mean to scare you, they just need nail clippers.
