Nicole Powers used to compete against women
— but Powers came to the realization that it was
unfair.

Powers is a transgender woman who has golfed
against biological females. Powers has also
competed in many other sports.

"| had to take a step back and realize that
biological realities are real and competitive
advantages will always exist despite the number
of years or whatever surgeries and hormones
you've done, and then understood that my place
is not in women's sports,’ Powers said in a recent
interview with OutKick.
