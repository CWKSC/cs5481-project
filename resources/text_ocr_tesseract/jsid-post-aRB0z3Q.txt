Lade with mer

tic

They don’t know that the
‘name Gandalf comes from
Norse mythology in the
poem Voluspa, stanza 12,
where the name Gandaifr is

mentioned first as the nar

of some dwarf, with the
something
lines of "magic
elf", which makes sense as
another word for dwarf is

“dark elf”, as dwarfs in
Norse myth are a version

elves that live

underground

Let’s call him
Grand Elf! Haha!
