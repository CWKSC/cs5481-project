i'll be like 40 w/no kids and people will say
“aw i'm so sorry for you” and i'll be like how
was the fi g wiggles reunion tour a Hei
went to italy last week for fun and didn’t have
to hire a sitter

This is a very sad mentality. To think oneself
more important than that of progeny is the
sign of a failed human life.
