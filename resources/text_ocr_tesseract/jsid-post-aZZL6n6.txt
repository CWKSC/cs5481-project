"And that's when | realized, Ernie, that if God doesn't exist,
then everything is permissible. The universe doesn't care
what happens to me, or to you, or to the seven billion
people on the planet. It won't hear them cry out. It won't
shed a tear when they're gone. Humanity doesn't even
register on the cosmic scales. You have to understand,
Erie, that what I'm doing isn't mass murder. It isn’t
genocide. It isn't a terrible atrocity. It just.../s.”
