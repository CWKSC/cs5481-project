Khadra, who appeared in a TV interview, said, In
2022, | met a man on Facebook who had a much.
better character than my husband. We developed a
deep love, even though | was a married woman with
three children.

Eventually, he persuaded me to argue with my
husband and seek a divorce, which | did. On the
same day | got divorced, he blocked me on every
platform we used to communicate.

Her husband was behind that account @ @
