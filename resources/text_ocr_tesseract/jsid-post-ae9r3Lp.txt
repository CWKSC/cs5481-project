Hi lan, trust your okay and now settled in your
new home. | am wanting to use your Netflix
but to make life easier view it through our
Sky Q rather than using Apple TV. In order

to do this | need to input your email address
and password. If you are ok with this would
appreciate you forwarding or for security
ringing me with your details.

Many thanks Dad
