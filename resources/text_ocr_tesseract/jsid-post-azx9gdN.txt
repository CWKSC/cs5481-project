Not bad, | have spent around 4 minutes completing captcha-s and email + sms
verifiations

“Tying to log into an already exsting account is a quick time event:

~ you get code, alk you cannot copy. and a QR code that doesn't work

= the code expres in 14 minutes, you have to restart the captchas Ifyou run out of time
= when you ty to login, each time you have to fil an increasing numberof captchas (my
pbis10)

= the captcha has an increasing numberof images, with dices on them which you have to
sum up and try to find the one image that shows the amount required

“if you just fall one, you start over

when you pass this part there is 10% chance it doesn't show a random error

“in ease it works, you need to either confirm with ema or sms (eed Both sms less
bering)

~ at this point you have @ 20% chance that you get “Accept terms of service" page,
otherwise you ae logged out and start again

“if you manage to accept that, you can play the game

“Time to beat: 45 minutes GLHF

‘Also, there s some kind of shooter game after ths part, donot recommend that one.
