>First day as CEO

>Fire anyone with:

1) Pronouns in Bio

2) Brightly colored hair

3) Overt activism on their public Social
Media Profiles

4) The entire HR team

Results:

>Costs get cut by 60% by laying off all
the useless deadweight & keeping only
meritorious devs

>Games get made for GAMERS and not
a screeching activist minority
>Customers LIKE the games again
instead of actively rejecting them

Congratulations, Ubisoft is highly
profitable again.
