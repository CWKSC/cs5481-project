Religion has affected trans people at
my school

Ihave a friend who is a trans girl. She used to be
able to use the girls bathroom with no problem,
but apparently, she was in there when a Muslim
girl was. And the girl cried because "a man saw
her hair". So now all trans people ay my school
have to use the bathroom that matches their sex
