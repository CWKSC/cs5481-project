Tasty and portable but | use these for trapping
rats because the rats love them

| love these but | had to stop beating them due to
the sodium. We have an occasional rat problem on
our property and when | set out the traps | started
using small pieces of these instead of peanut butter
and they are virtually 100% effective because they
are irresistible and stick to the Trap better rather
than something that can be easily licked off like
peanut butter. Because they grip the trigger
mechanism better and they are so delicious the rats
can't help themselves but to get caught
