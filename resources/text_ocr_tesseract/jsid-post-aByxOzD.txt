Tell me something about love that
people don't often realize?

© One thing people don't often realize about
love is that it's less about grand gestures
and intense feelings, and more about
consistent, quiet commitment. Love thrives
in the everyday moments—showing up,
listening, and supporting someone even
when it's mundane or challenging. It's not
always the fireworks, but the willingness to
work through difficult times and still choose
each other. Love is often built in the ordinary,

not just found in the extraordinary.
