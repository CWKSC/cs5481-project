Tell howThe Jedi Order's problem
Is Yoda. No being can wield that
kind of power for centuries without
‘becoming complacent at best or
corrupt at worst. He has no idea
that it's overtaken him; he no
longer sees all the little cumulative
‘evils that the Republic tolerates
and fosters, from slavery to
endless wars, and he never asks,
“Why are we not acting to stop
this?” Live alongside corruption for
too long, and you no longer notice
the stench. The Jedi cannot help
the slaves of Tatooine, but they
‘can help the slavemasters.
