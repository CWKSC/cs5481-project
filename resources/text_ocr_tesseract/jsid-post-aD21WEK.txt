Wouldn't it be crazy if one of the richest
lithium deposits in the world was right
outside of Asheville North Carolina?

Wouldn't it be crazy if the largest lithium
mining company in the world 3 days before
the flood began, submitted the permits for

their mine right outside Asheville North

Carolina?

Wouldn't it be crazy if the mining company

was just given $250 million dollars in grants

to help with construction of their mine right
outside of Asheville North Carolina?

Wouldn't it be crazy if less than a month
before the flood started, Blackrock acquired
2.2 million shares of stock in the mining
company

Wouldn't it be crazy if the residents that
opposed the mine had their homes and
property destroyed?
