A soulmate,

is someone who challenges
you to be better, someone who cantt
stand seeing you sad, someone who
stays faithful, loyal and committed
to you, someone who helps
take care of you when
youre sick,

someone who stands
by your side through the
‘good days and the bad days,
and someone who wants
to grow old and grey
with you.
