she must be busy 9

maybe shedon't 4’
__, fave
notifications on

she's thinking of a
good way to reply

she will reply tomorrow,
she must be sleeping
it's already 7pm

It takes her a long time
to reply not because she’s busy
but because she does not
want to chat with me

She cancels plans
with me when she finds
literally anything else
todo

She initiates small

fights in which she tries § =
to demean me ee *
My only purpose
in her life is to give her attention ~
and boost her confidence
when asked
I'm not going to waste
my time and energy
this way anymore
Hi, do you
ny have any plans
1 this weekend?
