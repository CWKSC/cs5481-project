ARE You
GoING To SLEEP?

In Darth Vader's death scene, you can
hear blaster shots going off in the
background. Luke is the only Rebel on
Death Star 2, and the stormtroopers

ren't shooting at him. The Death Star
is getting ready to explode, and all the
imperial troops are evacuating. So the
only thing those blaster shots could be
are stormtroopers killing each other
for spots on the ships.
