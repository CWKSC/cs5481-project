Plot twist

Obi wan is the king of low grounds, not high
grounds. He defeated both maul and grievous by
having the low ground. When he told anakin “! have
the high ground’ it was simply to tempt him to jump
and and get the high ground, therefore giving Obi
wan the low ground where he could easily take him
down. Obi wan is the master of trolling.
