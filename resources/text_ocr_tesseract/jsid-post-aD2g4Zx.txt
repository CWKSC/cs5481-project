Sugar daddy gave me counterfeit money
during our date, then blocked me on
Instagram after. What do I do?

Discussion

So, this guy hit me up on Instagram saying that he
wanted to be my SD, and I was interested! He told
me that he gives a weekly allowance of $500 so that
definitely caught my interest.

We decided to meet up on Saturday night, and he
wanted to cuddle and make out in his car. He gave me
the money before we started, and I should have turned
on the light to check to see if they were real...but I didn't.
So, we have fun for a few hours, and then he tells me he
had a fun time and leaves. As soon as I get into my car,
Iturn on the lights and check the money...they were all
fake 10's. It's basically the prop money that they use in
movies. I tried going to his Instagram profile but before
IT could, he blocked me and I didn't remember his full
name.

I'm so dumb for falling for this trap but what can I

do now that I have been scammed and violated by a
random stranger? Is this just something that I have to
learn from and let go of? What do you guys think?
