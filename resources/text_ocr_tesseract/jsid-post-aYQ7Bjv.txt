According to Dragon Age Veilguard,
when you misgender someone you
should do 10 pushups to show that you
are sorry and to remind yourself about
their desired pronouns. However, once
you've reached a certain point, you are
no longer progressing with push-ups -
same with other exercises. | make it a
habit to not just be a homophobic,
Islam-Jew hating white supremacist but
to be a fit and healthy homophobic,
Islam-Jew hating, white supremacist!
So here's my workout progression

(which isn't limited to just misgendering)

i. Misgendering: 10 pushups >too

easy 10 Pseudo Planche Pushups

ii. Homophobia: 10 Deep Squats >too
easy~ 10 pistol squats (5 each leg)

iii. lskamophobia/Antisemitism: 10
second Tuck L-Sit >too easy> 5 to 10
second L-Sit

iv. Racist: 5 second Tuck Planche >too

easy>5 second Advanced Tuck Planche

Remember to always warm up and
listen to your body before progressing

to harder variations!
