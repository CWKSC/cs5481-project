Stage One:

Initially, the sign (image
or representation) is a
reflection of basic reality.

Stage Two:

The sign masks a basic
reality. The image becomes
a distortion of reality.

Stage Three:

The sign marks the absence
of basic reality. The image calls
into question what the reality
is and if it even exists.

Stage Four:

The sign bears no relation
to any reality whatsoever; it
is its own pure simulacrum.
