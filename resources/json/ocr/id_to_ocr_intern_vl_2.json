He was the chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau from August 2024 and the Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip from February 2017 until his death, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh in both roles.\n\nSinwas was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Egyptian-controlled Gaza in 1962 to a family who had been expelled or fled from Ashkelon during the 1948 Palestine War. He finished his studies at the Islamic University of Gaza, where he received a bachelor's degree in Arabic studies. For orchestrating the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he considered to be collaborators in 1989, Sinwas was sentenced to four life sentences by Israel, of which he served 22 years until his release among 1,026 others in a 2011 prisoner exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. During his time in prison, Sinwas continued to coordinate the execution of Palestinians suspected of collaboration with Israel and planned the abduction of Israeli soldiers. In 2004 he received medical treatment from Israeli sources at the Saudi Medical Center for a kidney transplant.\n\nSinwas in 2011\nChairman of the Hamas Political Bureau\nIn office\n6 August 2024 \u2013 16 October 2024\nDeputy\nPreceded by\nIsmail Haniyeh",

    "jsid-post-aQzROpz": "ORIGIN OF MONTH NAMES\n\nOur lives run on Roman time. The names of our months are therefore derived from the Roman gods, leaders, festivals, and numbers.\n\nJANUARY\nJanuary is named after the Roman god Janus. As you can see in this print, he had two faces so he could see the future and the past.\n\nFEBRUARY\nFebruary is named after the Roman calendar month of Februarius, which was a festival of purification and atonement that took place during this period.\n\nMARCH\nMarch is named after Mars, the Roman god of War. This was the time of year to resume military campaigns that had been interrupted by winter.\n\nAPRIL\nApril takes its name from the Latin word aperire, meaning \"to open\" (just like flowers do in spring). The Romans called the month Aprilis.\n\nMAY\nNamed after the Roman goddess Maia, who oversaw the growth of plants. Maia was considered a nurturing earth goddess, which may explain the connection with this springtime month.\n\nJUNE\nNamed for the Roman goddess Juno, patroness of marriage. Also from the Latin word juvenes, \"young people.\"\n\nJULY\nThis month used to be called Quintilis - the Roman word for \"fifth\" as it was the fifth month of the Roman year. It was later changed to July by the Roman world, after Julius Caesar, after his family name (Julius).\n\nAUGUST\nThis month was first called Sextilis - the Roman word for \"sixth\" as it was the sixth month of the Roman year. It was later changed to August by the Emperor Augustus, and named it after himself.\n\nSEPTEMBER\nSeptember comes from the Latin word septem, meaning \"seven,\" because it was the seventh month of the early Roman calendar.\n\nOCTOBER\nIts name is derived from octo, Latin for \"eight,\" an indication of its position in the early Roman calendar.\n\nNOVEMBER\nNovember was the ninth month of the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC. November retained its name (from the Latin novem, meaning \"nine\") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar.\n\nDECEMBER\nIt comes from the Latin word decem, meaning ten, because this had been the tenth month of an early Roman calendar.",

However, once you've reached a certain point, you are no longer progressing with push-ups - same with other exercises. I make it a habit to not just be a homophobic, Islam-Jew hating white supremacist but to be a fit and healthy homophobic, Islam-Jew hating, white supremacist!\n\nSo here's my workout progression (which isn't limited to just misgendering)\n\ni. Misgendering: 10 pushups -> too easy -> 10 Pseudo Planche Pushups\n\nii. Homophobia: 10 Deep Squats -> too easy -> 10 pistol squats (5 each leg)\n\niii. Islamophobia/Antisemitism: 10 second Tuck L-Sit -> too easy -> 5 to 10 second L-Sit\n\niv. Racism: 5 second Tuck Planche -> too easy -> 5 second Advanced Tuck Planche\n\nRemember to always warm up and listen to your body before progressing to harder variations!",
