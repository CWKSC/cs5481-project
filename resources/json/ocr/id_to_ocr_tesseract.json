As licensed broadcasters\nthey were legally obligated to alert the\npublic, to tell them the nukes were flying\nand that in a few minutes all the world's\ntroubles would be over. What though was\nthe point of that? To torture people with the\nknowledge of something they couldn't\nchange?\n\nTheir eyes met and a decision was\nreached. Bert put on their most requested\nsong, a sugary top 40 tune while Ernie\nproduced a bottle of bourbon from under\nthe desk. As their producer banged on the\nlocked studio door the colleagues toasted\nthe end of a long career.\n\nBert, always the consummate professional,\nturned away from the window as the first\nexplosion split the distant horizon. He\nstraightened his tie, tucked in his shirt and\nbrushed his hair back. He would meet his\nfiery death with dignity.\n\nHe turned to Ernie and said in a quiet,\nresigned voice, \"How do | look, Ernie?\"\n\nErnie walked slowly over to his friend. He\nlooked into Bert's face and saw the\ncloseness they shared, the strength of\ntheir relationship, forged over the years.\nHe took a deep breath and spoke quietly:\n\n\"With your eyes, Bert.\"\n",

The Romans called the\nmonth Apritis\n\nNamed after the Roman\ngoddess Maia, who oversaw the\ngrowth of plants, Maia was\nconsidered a nurturer and an\nearth goddess, which may\nexplain the connection with this\nspringtime month.\n\nMAY\n\nJuno, patroness of marriage and\nthe well-being of women.

It was later\nchanged to August by the\nEmperor Augustus, and he\nnamed it after himself.\n\nAUGUST \u2014\u2014\n\n| Named for the Roman goddess\n\n\u2018September comes from the\n\nSEPTEMBER- VII Seceimane haa iie\n\nts name is derived from acto,\n\nOCTOBER \u2014 Vill ca\n\ncalendar.\n\nNovember was the ninth month\nof the calendar of Romulus c.\n\n750 8C.
